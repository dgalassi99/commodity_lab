# Commodity Lab 🚀

Welcome to **Commodity Lab**, my personal quant and coding playground focused on building real-world skills for commodity trading and quantitative finance.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is designed as a **hands-on learning hub** where I develop, test, and document projects related to:

- Data engineering & automation  
- Time series analysis and quant strategies  
- Risk metrics and portfolio analytics  
- Commodities market concepts and curve modeling  
- Visualization and dashboards  
- Putting it all together in automated pipelines

The goal is to build a solid, practical skillset aligned with roles at commodity trading firms.
