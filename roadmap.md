# Learning Roadmap for Commodity Trading Lab 

## Goal
Learn about the commodity market with my typical approach: "putting the hands in the dough".

*How?* 

Well, I have a ChemEng background, hence, I do have some technical knowledge about oil/gas extraction, refining, storing and transportation.. but I am missing the "market side of the coin".

The skills i need to acquire are the following

- Programming & data engineering: improve coding and scripting  
- Time series & quant analysis: get hands on into financial/quantitative analysis 
- Risk & portfolio metrics: be able to quantify risk and deal with it
- Commodity markets knowledge: read books, articles and more to be able to have a macroscopic view
- Visualization & automation: be able to present data and automate analysis to speed up the processes  

It looks great... but...

## Where do I start?

Well, I have nobody telling me what do to. It would be great to have a scheduled plan of actions. But no, this is not how it works. The only way is to start somewhere, try, shoot and adjust... repeating this cycle until convergence.

## Plan of Action

### Market Fundamentals + Basic Data
- [ ] Read: What is a commodity
- [ ] Read: Difference between spot and futures
- [ ] Read: Contango and backwardation
- [ ] Read: Seasonality and influencing factors
- [ ] Download historical data for 2 commodities (e.g., oil and wheat)
- [ ] Calculate daily returns and plot prices + returns
- [ ] Create `docs/market_basics.md` with written definitions in your own words

### Futures Structure + Curves
- [ ] Study term structure and roll yield
- [ ] Understand relationship between spot and futures
- [ ] Download futures data with different maturities
- [ ] Visualize futures curves over time
- [ ] Analyze contango/backwardation on the curves

### Fundamentals and Market Reports
- [ ] Learn how to read EIA, USDA, CFTC reports
- [ ] Understand key data influencing prices
- [ ] Download inventory data (EIA or USDA)
- [ ] Compare inventory data with price changes
- [ ] Update `docs/market_reports.md` with notes

### Quantitative Analysis and First Strategy
- [ ] Calculate rolling volatility on prices
- [ ] Build correlation matrix among commodities
- [ ] Test a simple strategy (e.g., long if price > 30-day MA)
- [ ] Create a basic dashboard (matplotlib, plotly, or other)

### Refinement and Deepening
- [ ] Deepen quantitative strategies
- [ ] Improve dashboard and visualizations
- [ ] Deepen understanding of fundamentalsâ€™ impact
- [ ] Organize and document everything in the repo

... Well nothing is carved in stone.. hence we will modify it ... tho we need tostart somewhere no?

Ciaoooooo :)
