# WHAT ABOUT THIS FOLDER?

This folder serves as a short description of the main refinery units (refining.md) and refinery producs (gasoline & distillates.md). 

As a chemical engineer I am tempted to go into technicalities but I will try to keep is as "non-technical' as possible. For more info you can refer to "Petroleum Refining"  by W.L. Leffler which is a nice (~200 pages) non-tech book for beginners/curious minds.

Enjoy the readings!
