# Gasoline, Distillate and Refinery Products

## Gasoline

This is the most important and questioned product of refinery. To understand how the production evolved we need to reply to:
- What happens when gasoline is burned into an engine?
- What are octane number and vapor pressure?
- Why lead was added? Why we can't blend it anymore?
- How does gasoline affect the environment?
- How is gasolin blended to mitigate environmental harm?
- How blending influences refinery operations?

### Gasoline Engine

There are some key parts: (1) fuel tank; (2) fuel pump; (3) fuel injector; (4) cylinder and pistons; (5) exhaust valves; (6) spark.

The fuel injection system has to be able to vaporize the fuel and mixes it with oxygen. Once into the cylinder the fuel/air mixture is compressed and ready for the ignition.
The spark gives the starting energy for the combustion which results in a controlled explosion releasing a huge amount of energy which drives the piston. Then the exhaust gases are exhausted via the valves before the motor returns in its original position. Each cycle requires the piston up and down twice --> four cyclinder engine (intake-compression-power-exhaust).

1. ** Reid Vapor Pressure - RVP **

One key point is to make sure the fuel is well vaporized. This is easy when the motor is warm. But what about the start off? The trick is to have enough volatile compounds --> Reid Vapor Pressure (Pvap in PSI measured at 100 Â°F). On the other hand, when the RVP is too high the vapor pressure can prevent air to get into the motor and to provide enough oxidant for the reaction.
Usually RVP ranges between 12 and 5 PSI (cold vs hot environments).

Sometimes in alditude (decrease of Patm) and hot environment the engine does not work cause the fuel vaporizes in the tank --> caviation of ignition pump --> Vapor Lock.
That is why RVP is usually lower in hot environments.

How to we make the right RVP? By blending! Usually iC4 and nC4 (RVPs in 50-70 range) are blended in. The calculation is simple as the final RVP is the volume average of the single species RPVs. 

We have to note that the RVP standard increases during winter season. Hence, during winter we can blend more butanes which increases the gasoline production. But during summer the demand for gasoline is higher. This create some asymmetries but the additional winter blending can be rearranged to produce more distillates. Also note that nC4 has a lower RVP, this means we can blend more nC4 than iC4 and increase more the produced volume of gasoline. Also, note that if no isomerization plant is present the iC4 has to be bought and is more expensive than the normal one.

### Octane Number

The ON refers to the motor knocking effect. When the air/fuel mixture is compressed, the heating due to compression can self ignite the combustion in the wrong moment and ruin the motor mechanics. Researches discovered that different mixtures have different knockings. We define the compression ratio at the ratio between the fully down and fully up piston configuration. Now, the bigger this ratio the higher the chance of self-ignition. So they defined a reference number, the octane number, which is the knocking effect isoctane gives at a given compression ratio. When using 100% iC8 the ON is 100, when using 100% nC7 is 0. Intermediate values are linear combinations of their volumes.

The test works like this. You fix a starting compression ratio and test your mixture. You increase the compression ratio until self-ignition occurs. Once you have this critical ratio, you test mixtures of iC8/nC7 to find the actual ON of the starting mixture.

There are two standards:
- Research Octane Number (RON) --> tests under mild conditions
- Motor Octane Number (MON) --> testing the motor into severe conditions

Which one we show? On gas pumps the current standard we use is simply their average AKI (Anti Knocking Index) = (MON+RON/2) --> Why this?
- Solve controversies
- With this average, the linear approximation of volume averaged ON is a good fit (non linearities or RON-MON cancel out...almost!)

### Leaded Gasoline

You might have noticed that while butane increases RVP, it reduces the AKI. So?

Until the 70s lead (tetraethyl lead - TEL) was blended as it increases the AKI keeping the other factors constant. One gram/bbl could increase the AKI of 1-2 points. But its toxic...and it poisons the catalytic material in engines exhaust lines... ciao ciao lead!

### Petrochmical Blending Compounds

After lead ban, refineries pushed their reformers to max high AKI compounds. This, tho, reduced the amount of gasoline produced in terms of volume. To increase the voume the increased the cut point of the naptha to increase the feed to the cat reformer. But this produces more benzene, which is also cancirogen.

Extensive reaserch found out that MeOH (AKI 120), EtOH (AKI 119), TBA (AKI 98), MTBE (AKI 110), ETBE (AKI 110) ... were good compounds for this AKI increase/Stay in line with safety operation. 

### Pollutants 

Main issues are with TOX, SOX, NOX, VOCs --> Solutions? --> Gasoline Blensing is now very hard!!!

- CO fomres if combustion runs in oxygen deficiency --> having oxigenated compounds in the blending helps the full oxidation of carbon to CO2
- SOx depends on the sulphur amount in the crude --> Desulphurization
- NOx on combustion temperatures --> catalytic exhausts
- TOX and VOCs are hydrocarbons that are not fully --> same as CO
