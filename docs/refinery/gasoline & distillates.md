# Gasoline, Distillate and Refinery Products

## Gasoline

This is the most important and questioned product of refinery. To understand how the production evolved we need to reply to:
- What happens when gasoline is burned into an engine?
- What are octane number and vapor pressure?
- Why lead was added? Why we can't blend it anymore?
- How does gasoline affect the environment?
- How is gasolin blended to mitigate environmental harm?
- How blending influences refinery operations?

### Gasoline Engine

There are some key parts: (1) fuel tank; (2) fuel pump; (3) fuel injector; (4) cylinder and pistons; (5) exhaust valves; (6) spark.

The fuel injection system has to be able to vaporize the fuel and mixes it with oxygen. Once into the cylinder the fuel/air mixture is compressed and ready for the ignition.
The spark gives the starting energy for the combustion which results in a controlled explosion releasing a huge amount of energy which drives the piston. Then the exhaust gases are exhausted via the valves before the motor returns in its original position. Each cycle requires the piston up and down twice --> four cyclinder engine (intake-compression-power-exhaust).

1. ** Reid Vapor Pressure - RVP **

One key point is to make sure the fuel is well vaporized. This is easy when the motor is warm. But what about the start off? The trick is to have enough volatile compounds --> Reid Vapor Pressure (Pvap in PSI measured at 100 Â°F). On the other hand, when the RVP is too high the vapor pressure can prevent air to get into the motor and to provide enough oxidant for the reaction.
Usually RVP ranges between 12 and 5 PSI (cold vs hot environments).

Sometimes in alditude (decrease of Patm) and hot environment the engine does not work cause the fuel vaporizes in the tank --> caviation of ignition pump --> Vapor Lock.
That is why RVP is usually lower in hot environments.

How to we make the right RVP? By blending! Usually iC4 and nC4 (RVPs in 50-70 range) are blended in. The calculation is simple as the final RVP is the volume average of the single species RPVs. 

We have to note that the RVP standard increases during winter season. Hence, during winter we can blend more butanes which increases the gasoline production. But during summer the demand for gasoline is higher. This create some asymmetries but the additional winter blending can be rearranged to produce more distillates. Also note that nC4 has a lower RVP, this means we can blend more nC4 than iC4 and increase more the produced volume of gasoline. Also, note that if no isomerization plant is present the iC4 has to be bought and is more expensive than the normal one.

### Octane Number

The ON refers to the motor knocking effect. When the air/fuel mixture is compressed, the heating due to compression can self ignite the combustion in the wrong moment and ruin the motor mechanics. Researches discovered that different mixtures have different knockings. We define the compression ratio at the ratio between the fully down and fully up piston configuration. Now, the bigger this ratio the higher the chance of self-ignition. So they defined a reference number, the octane number, which is the knocking effect isoctane gives at a given compression ratio. When using 100% iC8 the ON is 100, when using 100% nC7 is 0. Intermediate values are linear combinations of their volumes.

The test works like this. You fix a starting compression ratio and test your mixture. You increase the compression ratio until self-ignition occurs. Once you have this critical ratio, you test mixtures of iC8/nC7 to find the actual ON of the starting mixture.

There are two standards:
- Research Octane Number (RON) --> tests under mild conditions
- Motor Octane Number (MON) --> testing the motor into severe conditions

Which one we show? On gas pumps the current standard we use is simply their average AKI (Anti Knocking Index) = (MON+RON/2) --> Why this?
- Solve controversies
- With this average, the linear approximation of volume averaged ON is a good fit (non linearities or RON-MON cancel out...almost!)

### Leaded Gasoline

You might have noticed that while butane increases RVP, it reduces the AKI. So?

Until the 70s lead (tetraethyl lead - TEL) was blended as it increases the AKI keeping the other factors constant. One gram/bbl could increase the AKI of 1-2 points. But its toxic...and it poisons the catalytic material in engines exhaust lines... ciao ciao lead!

### Petrochmical Blending Compounds

After lead ban, refineries pushed their reformers to max high AKI compounds. This, tho, reduced the amount of gasoline produced in terms of volume. To increase the voume the increased the cut point of the naptha to increase the feed to the cat reformer. But this produces more benzene, which is also cancirogen.

Extensive reaserch found out that MeOH (AKI 120), EtOH (AKI 119), TBA (AKI 98), MTBE (AKI 110), ETBE (AKI 110) ... were good compounds for this AKI increase/Stay in line with safety operation. 

### Pollutants 

Main issues are with TOX, SOX, NOX, VOCs --> Solutions? --> Gasoline Blensing is now very hard!!!

- CO fomres if combustion runs in oxygen deficiency --> having oxigenated compounds in the blending helps the full oxidation of carbon to CO2
- SOx depends on the sulphur amount in the crude --> Desulphurization
- NOx on combustion temperatures --> catalytic exhausts
- TOX and VOCs are hydrocarbons that are not fully --> same as CO 


## Distillates and Residuals

### Kerosene and Jet Fuel

Medium frac product hydrotreated to jet fuel --> high specifications in terms of properties at low temperatures (solidificaton, viscosity, smoke point and aromatic contents)

### Heating Oil

From number 1 to number 6. Low numbers mostly used to domestic/industrial heating while hihg number for marine applications.

### Diesel

Diesel engine differs from the gasoline motor.
- It has two instead of four cycles
- No spark is needed for ignition
- Has an high boiling point

The steps are: (1) air intake and exhaust released; (2) air compression (gets very hot); (3) injection and power (as the nebulzied diesel is injected) ;(4) the air is so hot that auto ignition of fuel droplets occurs... (i) repeat.

While for gasoline engine autoignition is an issue, here is a resoruce --> Cetane Number as measure of self-ignitability --> C16H34 (100 CN) vs alpha-metyl-napthalene C11H22 (0 CN) --> usually we refer to the Cetane Index (CI).

Also blending is quite opposite to gasoline as we want a high content of paraffines and low amount of aromatics/isomers. The main components are cracked or straght run LGOs or LGOs from hydrocracking as hydrogen excess favors the formation of sat compounds. Usually the commerical CN oscilattes around 50.

### Residual Fuels

Basically contains flasher bottoms which is blended with cracked HGO to reduce the viscosity. Finds application as:
- Boiler fuel for steam generators
- Marine diesel fuel in special heavy diesel motors as sulphur emission threshold is higher in the open seas


2. Reaction 2H2S + SO2 -> 3S + 2H2O

## Asphault

Heavy crude oils contain an high concentration of asphaltenes (complex molecules of different aromatic rings and ethyl groups) in their straight run residue. Those stream find business in road construction whenever there is demand for.

We can divide asphalts into:
- Straight run asphalt
- Cutback asphalt
- Emulsion asphalt --> this and above for paving roads
- Industrial asphalt --> pipe coating, roof coating or general waterproof applciation

Quality is checked via softening point (lowest temperature at which a standard objects sink in the asphault) and penetration (how deep a needle goes when pushed with a weight for a given time).

### Straight run asphalts

Now asphalt can come from straight run or from the bottom of the flasher unit. Some consideration follow:
- If those heavy stream have still a big amount of paraffines their are extracted with solvents
- If the flahser top streams has asphaltenes you can either pray that the cat cracked will break them or extract those with:
    1. Propane deasphalting -> propane solubilizes paraffines and naphetenes but not asphaltenes
    2. Residual Oil Supercritical Extraction (ROSE) process -> multi extraction with C3-C4-C5

### Cutback asphalts 

Adding diluent to reduce the temperature at which paving can be done (flow temperature) while keeping it hard when cooled down. Diluents are naphta, kerosene or gas oil. The lighter the diluent the faster the curing rate (time to wait for hardening and by letting the diluent evaporate). The issue is that policies want to minimize those evaporations...

### Emulsion asphalts

Water (30/40%) asphalt emulsion to favor reduce the flow temperature --> water droplets of orders of microns for homogeneity + emulsifiers

### Blown asphalts

Air is blown in the bottom flasher mixture stimulating "gluing reactions" between asphaltenes molecules whihc increases penetration and and hardness. This is required for industrial waterproofing applications
