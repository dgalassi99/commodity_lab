# Refinery: Main Processes

## Hydrogen, Hydrotreating and Sulphur Plants

### Hydrotreating

Any stream of C6+ will contain some sulphur even in sweet crudes. Moslty as a constituent of aromatic rings it has to be removed by hydrotreating. It consists in blending those streams with H2, chlorine and heat them up in a catalytic bed of Co-Mo-W. 

Basically, H2
- combines with S to form H2S
- reduces nitrogen compounds are NH4
- saturates olefins and aromatics into paraffines

Moreover Cl2 reacts with metals and form chlorides.

Simple config as heater, reactor and flash to exhaust H2 to be recycled and a stabilizer to split C4- and hydrotreated products. This step is key as:
- Removal of metals, S and N which can poison cats in cracking and reforming ops.
- Reduces S to meet environmental policies
- Increases the sat fraction of the crude

Hydrotreating also improves:
- the quality fo jet fuel as increasing the H/C ratio imbroves the combustion and reduces the smoke point (smoke due to non full oxidations to H2O and CO2). 
- it also promotes more sats which increase the CI of diesels
- protects reformers catalyst increasing the converions

On thhe other end:
- more sats less AKI in gasolines 

### Hydrogen Sources

Mostly produced during the car reforming but also via:
- SMR (Steam Methane Reformer) is an high T high P reactor to process CH4 + H20 -> CO + 3H2 ---> CO + H2O -> CO2 + H2 then CO2 removed by absorption
- Swing adsorption or cryogenic distillation of light stream separating H2

### Sulphur Facilities

Once formed, H2S must be removed as it oxidate to SOx during combustion reactions. The most common way is an absorption with methyl ammines (MEA, DEA, TEA) followed by a stripping unit to regenerate the solvent.

The H2S is further oxidated via the Claus process:
1. Combustion 2H2S + 2O2 -> SO2 + S + 2H2O

## Distilling



## Isomerization 

### Isobutane

Refineries with hydrocrackers are likelyto have a surplus of iC4, but with a cat cracekr and an alky plant only it is hard to produce enough iC4 to match propylene and butylenes feeds. 

So two options:
- But some iC4
- Produce it via butane isomerization (BI plant)

The feed is mostly iC4-nC4. Normally we deisobutanize and feed the nC4 to a pt-catalyzed reactor. H2 is added to minimize coke formation, still we have by-products auch as C3-.
A stabiliezer separates the light components on top and recycles the iC4/nC4 back at the feed point (iC4 is extracted the the first deisobutanizer).

### C5/C6

If we want to increase the octane number (ON) we can isomerize C5 (ON from 62 to 95) and C6 (from 25 to 75).

Teb are iC5 < nC5 < iC6 < nC6.

The process is similar to C4 isomerization but more columns are needed for separation. That is we extract the isomerates and recycle the normal hydrocarbons back to the reactor feed.

## Residue Reduction

The main goal is to crack the vacuum flashing bottom (or straight run bottoms) to lighter components. 

We can use several units depending on:
- the capital we can invest in
- quality of the feed and prices od the products 
- coke quality production and value added by coking 

Generally:

- If feedstock quality is high (HGO and flasher tops) --> HC and FCC --> as yield in light products is high --> high value added
- If feed quality is low (stright run residue/ flasher bottoms) and capital is low --> coking, visbreaking and thermal cracking --> low light yield
- If feed quality is low (stright run residue/ flasher bottoms) and capital is high --> RHU and RFCC -->  decent yields 



### Thermal Cracking and Visbreaking (Low capital)

Feed mostly made of straight run bottom and/or flasher bottoms and/or cat HGO. Fed through a furnace at high P and low residence time (minimize coke formation).
The mixu=ture is quenched to stop the cracking process and a flash + fractionator follow. C4 and lighter go to gas plants or to alky plants. Gasoline and oil used as blends for gasoline and distillates.

### Coking (Medium Capital)

We can have three configs: delayed, fluid and flexi cokers. We focus on the first on being the most commonly used.

In the thermal crackinig we saw that increasing the space velocity (decreasing residence time) in the furnace pipes reduces coking. So the idea is to insert come drums and increase the residence time of the mixture there so force the coking formation to happen here (big drus where the removal is easier than inside heatEx pipes!).

The config is a fast pass in a furance to heat up and a "slow bbq cooking" in the coke drums. Vapors exit from the top and are separated via distillation. What is left behind are very heavy, low hydrogen compounds that are mostly coke.

To decoke the drums we use high pressure water jets. The coke left is similar to carbon but with some heavy hydrocarbons inside. If untreated is sold as green coke for combustion in cement klinks or blended with coal. If could be coked at very high T to remove leftover and have a sponge coke or needle coke. Those application in high temperature industries (electric arcs, welding machines...)

## Residue Cat/Hydro Cracking

### Residue Fluid Cat Cracking (RFCC)

The plant structure is similar but bigger risers (higher residence time) and bigger regeneration chambers (more coking) are designed. Also catalysts are engineered for the specific heavy feed.

### Residue Hydro Cracking (RHC)

Again scaled up wrt lighter feed plants. Usually the cat is a fludized bed with a strong hydrogen excess.
