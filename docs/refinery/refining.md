# Refinery: Main Processes

Notes from "Petroleum Refining" by W.L. Leffler + Some insights of a chemical engineer!

The refinery is a very complex system of separation, reacting and mixing units. The main goal of a refinery system is, of course, the profit maximization. Technicalities, tho, play a crucial role. Understanding how the different "organs" of the refinery communicate and exchange fluids/streams is a prerequisiste to understand oil supply.

## Before getting to the refinery

### How oil formes

In writing this document, I would like to take the perpective of the crude itself. What do I mean by this? I mean that I will describe the units and the process as if I am a little molecule dispersed in the complex crude system, who, being part ogf this moving fluid will follow different tratments and see the units one by one.

Before getting to the refinery (this part is not described in the book but I think is as important as the refinery system itself) the crude is pre-treated.

Crude is nothing than organic complex material that went through (veeeeeery) slow cracking and isomeriation reactions in the underground (we will see some of those reactions later...). Organic material is mostly made of C, H, O, S (hope you know which atoms we are talking about), those atoms form complex molecular structures that are the precursors of the black gold.

Organic material cumulates in the underground, and, if we are lucky gets trapped there in between non permeable rocks (oil reservoirs). Now, organic molecules are big, long, complex molecules that undergo mostly cracking reactions. 

What?

Well cracking has to be literally interpret. Those molecules are broken down to simpler, lighter and more linear ones. Cracking occurs in the underground due to high pressure environments and some geological heat that favors the thermodynamic of those reactions. Now, we need not to get too much into those mechanism, but here is what you need to know:

- the older the reservoir the longer the time span during which moleculues are cracked --> there will be ligher (smaller) molecules in the crude composition
- the light molecules (butane, propane, ethane, methane ...) are vapors in normal condition 
- water is also formed during those reactions

So how does a reservoir look like? Imagine it as a undeground hole with an unpermeable rock layer (dome) that traps the fluids from rising. Now this dome is full of fluids that stratify due to density differences and immiscibility. To say it simple, take an old jar and fill 1/3 of it with water, then fill another 1/3 of it with cooking oil, finally take the cork and close it. 

This simple sistem has three different phases (chemically speaking phases). There will be air on top, than a layer of oil and finally a layer of water. This si because teh air density < oil density < water density and because oil and water are immiscible liquids. Well an oil dome looks like this (other than air is replaced with hydrocarburic vapors).

### Extracting oil

Great, now we have an idea of what an oil reservoir looks like.

## Hydrogen, Hydrotreating and Sulphur Plants

### Hydrotreating

Any stream of C6+ will contain some sulphur even in sweet crudes. Moslty as a constituent of aromatic rings it has to be removed by hydrotreating. It consists in blending those streams with H2, chlorine and heat them up in a catalytic bed of Co-Mo-W. 

Basically, H2
- combines with S to form H2S
- reduces nitrogen compounds are NH4
- saturates olefins and aromatics into paraffines

Moreover Cl2 reacts with metals and form chlorides.

Simple config as heater, reactor and flash to exhaust H2 to be recycled and a stabilizer to split C4- and hydrotreated products. This step is key as:
- Removal of metals, S and N which can poison cats in cracking and reforming ops.
- Reduces S to meet environmental policies
- Increases the sat fraction of the crude

Hydrotreating also improves:
- the quality fo jet fuel as increasing the H/C ratio imbroves the combustion and reduces the smoke point (smoke due to non full oxidations to H2O and CO2). 
- it also promotes more sats which increase the CI of diesels
- protects reformers catalyst increasing the converions

On thhe other end:
- more sats less AKI in gasolines 

### Hydrogen Sources

Mostly produced during the car reforming but also via:
- SMR (Steam Methane Reformer) is an high T high P reactor to process CH4 + H20 -> CO + 3H2 ---> CO + H2O -> CO2 + H2 then CO2 removed by absorption
- Swing adsorption or cryogenic distillation of light stream separating H2

### Sulphur Facilities

Once formed, H2S must be removed as it oxidate to SOx during combustion reactions. The most common way is an absorption with methyl ammines (MEA, DEA, TEA) followed by a stripping unit to regenerate the solvent.

The H2S is further oxidated via the Claus process:
1. Combustion 2H2S + 2O2 -> SO2 + S + 2H2O

## Distilling



## Isomerization 

### Isobutane

Refineries with hydrocrackers are likelyto have a surplus of iC4, but with a cat cracekr and an alky plant only it is hard to produce enough iC4 to match propylene and butylenes feeds. 

So two options:
- But some iC4
- Produce it via butane isomerization (BI plant)

The feed is mostly iC4-nC4. Normally we deisobutanize and feed the nC4 to a pt-catalyzed reactor. H2 is added to minimize coke formation, still we have by-products auch as C3-.
A stabiliezer separates the light components on top and recycles the iC4/nC4 back at the feed point (iC4 is extracted the the first deisobutanizer).

### C5/C6

If we want to increase the octane number (ON) we can isomerize C5 (ON from 62 to 95) and C6 (from 25 to 75).

Teb are iC5 < nC5 < iC6 < nC6.

The process is similar to C4 isomerization but more columns are needed for separation. That is we extract the isomerates and recycle the normal hydrocarbons back to the reactor feed.

## Residue Reduction

The main goal is to crack the vacuum flashing bottom (or straight run bottoms) to lighter components. 

We can use several units depending on:
- the capital we can invest in
- quality of the feed and prices od the products 
- coke quality production and value added by coking 

Generally:

- If feedstock quality is high (HGO and flasher tops) --> HC and FCC --> as yield in light products is high --> high value added
- If feed quality is low (stright run residue/ flasher bottoms) and capital is low --> coking, visbreaking and thermal cracking --> low light yield
- If feed quality is low (stright run residue/ flasher bottoms) and capital is high --> RHU and RFCC -->  decent yields 



### Thermal Cracking and Visbreaking (Low capital)

Feed mostly made of straight run bottom and/or flasher bottoms and/or cat HGO. Fed through a furnace at high P and low residence time (minimize coke formation).
The mixu=ture is quenched to stop the cracking process and a flash + fractionator follow. C4 and lighter go to gas plants or to alky plants. Gasoline and oil used as blends for gasoline and distillates.

### Coking (Medium Capital)

We can have three configs: delayed, fluid and flexi cokers. We focus on the first on being the most commonly used.

In the thermal crackinig we saw that increasing the space velocity (decreasing residence time) in the furnace pipes reduces coking. So the idea is to insert come drums and increase the residence time of the mixture there so force the coking formation to happen here (big drus where the removal is easier than inside heatEx pipes!).

The config is a fast pass in a furance to heat up and a "slow bbq cooking" in the coke drums. Vapors exit from the top and are separated via distillation. What is left behind are very heavy, low hydrogen compounds that are mostly coke.

To decoke the drums we use high pressure water jets. The coke left is similar to carbon but with some heavy hydrocarbons inside. If untreated is sold as green coke for combustion in cement klinks or blended with coal. If could be coked at very high T to remove leftover and have a sponge coke or needle coke. Those application in high temperature industries (electric arcs, welding machines...)

## Residue Cat/Hydro Cracking

### Residue Fluid Cat Cracking (RFCC)

The plant structure is similar but bigger risers (higher residence time) and bigger regeneration chambers (more coking) are designed. Also catalysts are engineered for the specific heavy feed.

### Residue Hydro Cracking (RHC)

Again scaled up wrt lighter feed plants. Usually the cat is a fludized bed with a strong hydrogen excess.

## Aromatics Recovery

Removal of aromatics is done due to:
1. Pollution
2. They are more valuable when not mixed with other hydrocarbons (Xilene, Benzene, Toluene)
3. Recude values of products (benzene in gasoline, smoke point in kerosene)

### Solvent Extraction for BTX

The solvent must be selective vs aromatics and have a different volatility to facilitate its regeneration via distillation. 

Let's use the BTX recovery as an example. Straight run gasoline or reformate are fed to a distillation unit where light compouns are extracted as distillates. The bottom rich in aromatics is feed in another column. Heavy aromatics exit from the bottom while the column head (rich in BTX) is sent to a solvent extraction unit. The solvent extracts BTX, and then is fractionated to recover the solvent and get the BTX. The raffinate stream is a de-aromatized gasoline cut that can be used in gasoline blending.

## Simple and Complex Refineries

### Measuring Profitability 

The essence of the structure around pricing and profitability is relative to the refineries ability to vary the production and to produce high value chemicals. 

Hence, the refinery structure/configuration allows several mods and production flexibility. There are three main kind of refinery:

- Simple (Hydroskimming) --> distillation + reforming + hydrotreating
- Complex --> as before + flasher + cracker + gas processing
- Very Complex --> as before + coker + visbreaker

Increasing complexity increases the ratio light to heavy products --> higher value products --> higher margins 

Let's do a calculation to compare. Suppose we have a simple and a complex refinery:

1. Production from 1 bbl of medium quality crude:

- --> Gain is the extra volume produced as we make ligher than feed avg. products

- Simple refinery: 0.3 gasoline, 0.1 jet fuel, 0.2 distillate fuel, 0.35 residual fuel, 0.08 refinery fuel --> gain 0.03 
- Complex refinery: 0.5 gasoline, 0.1 jet fuel, 0.25 distillate fuel, 0.1 residual fuel, 0.12 refinery fuel --> gain 0.1 

2. Margins

Assuming prices are: 90 USD/bbl gasoline, 85 USD/bbl jet fuel, 80 USD/bbl distillate fuel, 55 USD/bbl residual fuel, 0 USD/bbl refinery fuel, 65 USD/bbl crude
- Simple refinery revenues: 70.75 USD/bbl - 65 USD/bbl - 1 USD/bbl (other costs) = 4.75 USD/bbl
- Complex refinery revenues: 79 USD/bbl - 65 USD/bbl - 3 USD/bbl (other costs) = 11 USD/bbl

Notice: (1) complex refinery produce more light products; (2) ligher products sell at higher prices; (3) operating cost are higher for complex refineries; (4) overall revenues increases with complexity; (5) this delta/spread increase as the quality of the crude goes down.

Point (5) is key --> when crude quality is very low --> simple refineries do not have enough processing power to make it profitable --> can't take advantage of the light/heavy price differential (LHPD)

Now suppose refining margins today, for different crudes, are (LHPD ~ 7 USD/bbl):

- light crude --> simple 1 USD/bbl, complex 5 USD/bbl, very complex 10 USD/bbl
- medium crude --> simple -2 USD/bbl, complex 8 USD/bbl, very complex 13 USD/bbl
- light crude --> simple -1 USD/bbl, complex 4 USD/bbl, very complex 18 USD/bbl

You can notice that simple refineries can't exploit the LHPD and can only process light crude, simple refineries should push to improve their structure and increase complexity.
This results in:

- decrease LHPD as more refineris profit from heavy crudes --> price of heavy cruce increase more relatively to light one
- margins are reduces for all and sometimes simple can outperform the complex --> complex may want to be simplified and the cycle restarts...

What set prices?

We have to think and consider several points which are the usual demand supply equilibria... for example:
- Strong demand --> complex refinery fill up first as they can make valuable products from any feed. But if they are full product prices rise and also simple refineries are profitable even if feeding light crudes
- If cokers and crackers fill up (bottleneck) heavy crudes are less attractive than light ones and the LHPD increases 

This is an example, each case must be logically developed!
