### USD Strenght

Crude is globally priced in USD --> its prices move relatively

- **Strenghtening USD:** USD/X (X = other currencies) increases --> oil becomes more expensive in other currencies --> global demand may soften --> downward pressure on spot prices
- **Weakening UDS:** USD/X (X = other currencies) decreases --> oil becomes cheaper in other currencies --> global demand rises --> upward pressure on spot prices

Moreover, if derivative products prices do not move at the same pace of the crude this can open chances for trades on crack spreads. For example, say DXY rises by 2%, and Brent drops by 1-2 USD/bbl, but gasoline does not drop --> trade the crack spread.

### Interest Rates

- In a high/increasing interest rates environment the economy slows down --> less fuel used --> demand decreases --> downward pressure. The opposite occurs in low/lowering interest rates situations.
- As rates increase teh cost of financing and insuring increases --> increase cost of storing --> storage is less attractive --> futures term curve can flatten or contango

Note: to explain this point ... remember $F = S e^{(c+r-y)t}$

- if c+r increases to the point that c+r = y (convenience yield) --> F = S --> flattens
- if c+r increases even more such that c+r > y --> F > S --> contango

### Inflation

In an inflationary environment commodity prices tend to rise. The table summarizes possible scenarios:

| Channel                  | Effect on Crude                               | Effect on Products                                           | Effect on Spreads / Crack                              |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Nominal Price Effect** | Oil prices rise in USD                        | Product prices rise too                                      | If product prices rise faster → crack widens           |
| **Real Demand Pressure** | High inflation may reduce real demand         | Demand for discretionary fuels (gasoline, jet fuel) may slow | Can narrow spreads if crude rises faster than products |
| **Monetary Response**    | Central banks raise rates → financing costs ↑ | Storage more expensive → reduces arbitrage opportunities     | Could flatten futures curve / reduce contango          |
| **Speculative Flows**    | Commodities attract investment as hedge       | Implied volatility may rise                                  | Crack volatility can increase                          |

## Macro Awareness

### OPEC - Biggest Exporter

OPEC controls around 40% of the global crude supply --> their decisions are key

Production cuts (hikes)

- Calendar spread: decreases (increase) supply --> spot and fronth month increase (decrease) --> backwardation (contango) --> roll yield (not) positive
- Crack Spred
    - if inventories are full --> refineries absorb the shock with inventories --> crude rises (softens) faster than products --> crack spread compresses 
    - if inventories are low --> refineries can't absorb the shock with inventories, specially if already at max production level --> crude rises (softens) slower than products --> crack spread widens

| Market Condition | Crude Price | Product Prices | Crack Spread |
| ---------------- | ----------- | -------------- | ------------ |
| High inventories | +\$5        | +\$2           | Compress     |
| Tight market     | +\$5        | +\$6           | Widen        |

### Russia - Sanctions

It is the major exporter to EU/Asia -- but --> sanctions or pipeline disruptions --> the gap is filled by WAF/USGC/Middle East 

Is it the same then? No!

- Freight cost is higher since transporting from US or WAF takes much more time than with North EU tankers or pipelines
- Since EU fell short on diesel the price sky rocketed
- When an enstablished route is disrupted the gap is filled in a less efficient way, specially when talking about products (not general crude). Adjust other refineries to increase diesel production takes time

Those effect increased the absolute price of diesel and increase the spread ULSD/Brent --> long ULSD/short Brent

Another effect is on calendar spreads. EU wants diesel now, hence spot and fronth month rise fasted than mid/long term contracts --> backwardation
Indeed, if the distruption affetcs future usage (say we have enough inventories to cover N months) we expect mid/long term to increase more than short/spot contract --> contango

### China - Biggest Importer

China is the biggest importer, so big that when its demand changes it affects WAF, Middle East, Russia and even USGC. Moreover, China is a crude importer and a big product exporter. This means that its action have effects on both sides.

Let's analyze two scenarios:

1. **COVID - Demand Drop**

Crude side: the import is reduced and Brent falls because cargoes can't clear and have to reroute somewhere else (usually increase in freight cost) and sell at discount. 
This weakens the Brent/Dubai spread as middle east needs to reroute wiht higher costs than Brent. Plus a low demand environment pushes the curve flatter/contango as current need for barrels disappears.

Product side: regional consumption decreases but refineries can still at high production. So they dumpen the producs at lower prices compressing the crack.

1. **Post COVID - Demand Surge**

Crude side: the import is aggresively increased and drives close supplier crude prices (Brent, Russia, Dubai) faster than WTI. Spot and front month rise sharply creasting a backwardation scenario.

Product side: local consumption increase and chinese products export decreases pulling up the prices widening the crack

## Refining Outages

Whichever issue that can slow down production in refineries. This mostly affect the local supply widening the cracks locally. This also can affect crude market depending on the refinery size. If big enough it influences global crude flows

- If mainly local --> crack spread widens
- If affects global --> calendar spreads may vary as crude flows are influenced

## Shipping Bottlenecks and Freight Rates

Typical congestion in key waterways (Panama, Suez, Hormutz) causes delays in delivery. This increases the freight cost reducing the spatial arbitrage opportunities.

$$ Arbitrage = Price difference - (Freight + Demurrage + Insurance + Storage)

Baltic Dirty/Clean Tankers indexes showing freight costs. They differ for routes and tankers size.

Tanker Classes?
1. Dirty Tankers
- VLCC (Very Large Crude Carriers): ~ 2 mbbl capacity used for for ME/WAF -> Asia --> key for asian crude arbitrage
- Suezmax: ~ 1 mbbl capacity used for WAF -> EU/ME/US (east coast) --> key for atlantic (WAF/EU/US) arbitrage
- Aframax/Panamax: ~ 0.5 mbbl used for short distances --> key for local arbitrage
2. Clean Tankers
- MR (Medium Range): ~ 0.4 mbbl used for USCG -> EU or intra Asia --> key for atlantic arbitrage
- LR1 (Long Range): ~ 0.7 mbbl used for ME -> Asia or USGC -> Africa
- LR2 (Long Long Range): ~ 1 mbbl -> ME -> Asia/EU --> key for Asian diesel crack
