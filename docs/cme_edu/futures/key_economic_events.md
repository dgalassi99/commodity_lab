# Key Economic Events

## GDP

GDP assesses the value fo finished goods and services produced by a country over a given period of time.

Economic indicators can generally be divided into:
- Coincidence indicators highlighting the current state of the economy
- Leading indicatoris showing where the economy is going
- Lagging indicators pointing out recent changes in the economy as a whole

### Annualied GDP reading 

GDP is a lagging indicator, nevertheless is one of the most important number the market will focus on. We mostly have to focus how much this figure deviates from the range of expectations released by analysists. As a fact, the bigger the deviation, the more volatile the reaction will be.

### Revisions 

The next most important figures are the revisions of GDP (with respect to the first reading). The first reading is released the first month after the end of a quarter and it is revised twice at a distance of two months from the preceeding data.

### Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE)

PCE accounts for 68% of the total GDP. Thus PCE is a very important varibale to monitor.

## Retail Sales Report

It is one of the FED most important data point, and it is released every month on or around the 13th. It reflects teh current state of the US economy and it is considered a goof indicator for inflationary pressures. 

It reflects teh sales from 13 major types of retailers such as: (1) Motor vehicle (20.6%); (2) Food and beverage (12,8%); (3) General merchandise (12.6%); (4) Food services (11.7%); (5) gas stations (8.2%); ...

This report is complex, so we pay attention to the key figures. First the *Advanced Retail Sales*, then the control group. This includes all sales excluding auto dealers, building material retailers, gas station, office supply stores, mobile homes and tobacco stores. This is used to better gauge the consumer spending situation in the US.

## Non-Farm Payroll Report

This is one of the most important monthly data point (released on the first friday of every month) as it indicates the situation of the job market in the US. The absolute data itself is not as important as the comparison between the release data and the previous ones or between the released data and the median expected estimates.

Other important data to monitor are: (1) Weekly jobless data; (2) ADP employment changes; (3) Emplyoment constituents of the monthly Institute of Suplly Management (ISM) and Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI).

When reading the report we neet to pay attention to those figures:
- Number of jobs created (headline figure) compared to analysts' expectations
- Unemployment rate 
- Fluctuations in wage inflation

Generally this report undergoes several updates/revisions due to complexity of data.

## Consumer and Producer Price Index (CPI and PPI)

Both PPI and CPI are key data release since are direclty used by the FED to balance their dual mandate: inflation and the job market.

Since PPI measures the costs of producing consumer goods, and commodity and food prices directly affect retail pricing, PPI is seen as a good pre-indicator of inflationary pressures.

By using information from various confidence and PMI reports, you can gauge price developments faced by consumer and producers alike over the past month. Monitoring energy prices and the general commodity outlook via the Retail Sales Report, which is considered to be another vital pre-inflationary indicator, can also help to correctly position traders ahead of the release. If there are large swings in commodity prices, the market will most likely focus on the PPI core reading as the most reliable statistic.

As a general rule, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) implements monetary policy to help maintain inflation rates of somewhere around 2% over the medium term. If the PPI or CPI numbers remain above this level, the Fed has to increase interest rates. On the other hand, an extended period of low or negative inflation means the central bank would consider actions that would stimulate the economy such as cutting interest rates or embarking on Quantitative Easing (QE).

## Housing Data

Healthy demand for housing is a strong indicator that the economy has underlying strength and that consumers feel confident in the economic outlook. If people are willing to buy or build a home, it says a lot about consumer confidence.

While the FED policy is largely centred on inflation expectations and the rate of job creation, activity in the housing market also plays a key role in the central bank’s assessment of economic health. At the same time, the housing market is particularly sensitive to mortgage rates and an increase or decrease in the federal funds rate will have a direct impact on consumer borrowing costs.

We need to monitor a number of monthly housing-related data releases with the focus primarily on:

- Housing Starts Report: is based on survey data from builders and contains information about new permits, housing starts and housing completions.
- New Home Sales Report: measures the number of transactions that occur with the signing of a sales contract or an acceptance of a deposit.
- Pending Home Sales Report: represents sales of existing homes when the contract has been signed but the transaction has not yet closed.
- Existing Home Sales Report: represents all home sales where the mortgage has closed and the home sale has been completed. 
- Weekly Mortgage Application Report: is put together by the Mortgage Bankers Association and is a broad indicator of serious consumer interest in purchasing a home.
Quarterly earnings for home improvement chains are also heavily impacted by the short- to medium-term outlook in housing. It is important for a trader to survey a broad range of surveys and indicators since certain data releases are better at helping to establish a forward-looking view of the housing market while others may be more suitable to analyse its current state.

## FOMC Report

The Fed, is the central banking system of the United States and is responsible for guiding U.S. monetary policy. The Fed is responsible for buying and selling U.S. government securities in the financial markets and setting interest rates and reserve requirements. 

The Fed by definition is dual-mandated, Fed policy makers are expected to achieve both stable prices and maximum employment. As a result, public statements made by the Fed and its governors are closely watched by traders, since even the smallest changes in monetary policy and federal funds rates can create large market-moving events.

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) consists of twelve members: the seven members of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and four of the remaining eleven Reserve Bank presidents, who serve one-year terms on a rotating basis.

For traders, FOMC meetings are a time of particular volatility because any change in federal fund rates can affect a range of economic variables such as short-term interest rates, foreign exchange rates, long-term interest rates, employment output and prices of goods and services.

The FOMC meets eight times a year to discuss monetary policy changes, review economic and financial conditions and assess price stability and employment output. These meetings take place every six weeks. Four of these meetings feature a Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) followed with a press conference by the chair. The minutes of the scheduled meetings are released three weeks after the date of the policy decision.

## Consumer Confidence Surveys (CCS)

Consumer confidence surveys are key indicators into the overall health of the economy. When people feel confident about the stability of their incomes it influences their spending and saving activities.

Therefore, reports such as Consumer Confidence Index (CCI) and University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment (MCSI) are of particular interest to traders since these reports include inflation expectations and outlooks for consumers.

### Consumer Confidence Index (CCI)

The CCI survey is conducted monthly and contains about 50 questions that track different aspects of consumer attitudes toward current and future business conditions, current and future employment conditions, and total family income for the next six months. This report is highly regarded by the Fed and can be a key factor in determining U.S. monetary policy.

### University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment

The University of Michigan’s MCSI survey is conducted by phone and tracks consumer opinions of their own finances and the near- and long-term economy. Preliminary data is released on or around the 10th of each month, with final and complete data released on or around the first of the following month.

### Sector-Specific Reports

It can be useful to relate consumer confidence to specific sectors of the economy, such as manufacturing versus non-manufacturing. In some instances, certain parts of the economy will perform better than others, and additional data can help traders to operate with a more sector-specific sense of consumer sentiment. One example of sector-specific report is the Philadelphia Fed Survey, which tracks the manufacturing sector

## Oil Data Report

As oil prices move up or down, inflation follows in the same direction. Energy is used for everything from heat to manufacturing to transportation, therefore if oil costs rise, so do the costs of many consumer products and the overall cost of living. In times of high oil prices, the Federal Reserve (Fed) may even adjust interest rates to prevent further inflation. 

When monitoring supply, energy traders pay particular attention to the weekly U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, which reports on U.S. crude oil inventories, both domestically and abroad. This report is released by EIA each Wednesday at 10:30 a.m. Eastern Time.

Traders also consult the American Petroleum Institute (API) Weekly Statistical Bulletin Report, released on Tuesdays at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time. This report covers U.S. Crude inventories and data related to refinery operations, as well as the production, imports and inventories of the four major petroleum products: motor gasoline, kerosene jet fuel, distillate fuel oil and residual fuel oil.

Additionally, the weekly Baker Hughes Rig Count, which reports on total U.S. oil rigs, may provide an indication of future oil production and inventories in the U.S.

Traders must also pay attention to international politics and policy. In the Middle East, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), regularly meets to exercise control over production quotas and oil prices. Since OPEC controls 60% of the world’s oil, OPEC policy changes can heavily impact global oil supply and demand.

One major difficulty when analysing the outlook for energy markets is that supply and demand are impacted by many diverse factors, including geo-political tensions, seasonal elements such as winter heat and summer driving, refinery outages and world events both in the U.S. and abroad.

For this reason, many successful oil traders maintain an in-depth knowledge of political issues in oil-producing regions, as well as a strong technical understanding of the refining process.
