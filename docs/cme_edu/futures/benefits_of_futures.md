# The Benefits of Trading Futures

## Portfolio Diversification

Portfolio diversification helps offset exposure in any single position, and helps investors protect themselves against wide swings in key sectors. Typically, traders diversify by trading both equities and bonds. But in times of market volatility, a portfolio can greatly benefit by the addition of futures and options on futures contracts. Futures and options on futures give market participants the opportunity to hedge against market risk by sector and to raise and lower levels of desired exposure in times of anticipated and unanticipated event-driven volatility.

## Day Trading Futures

We will look at some of the restrictions in the United States for day trading cash equity products and compare that to day trading with futures.

### Minimum Account Size
A pattern day trader who executes four or more round turns in a single security within a week is required to maintain a minimum equity of $25,000 in their brokerage account. But a futures trader is not required to meet this minimum account size. In fact, as long as you maintain the minimum margin requirements for your positions, you can trade as frequently as you like at a size suitable to your trading needs.

### Margin
An equity trader can only trade up to four times their maintenance margin excess on an intra-day basis. So if they have $30,000 maintenance excess available, they can only trade up to a value of $120,000. With futures, that same margin may afford you the ability to trade a much larger notional value.

### No Short Sale Restrictions
For equity day traders in order to short a security, there must be shares available to trade. In comparison, a futures trader does not have the same short sale restrictions. You can take a short position as easily as a long position.

### Minimum Tick
When a trader shorts a stock, they are required to sell at a minimum of a tick above last traded price. This means in a down-trending market, an equity trader may never get to take a short position. But futures trader can be short the market just as easily as being long.

## Benefit of Liquidity

Liquidity is the collective expression of traders' opinions on the market. These opinions are represented in a futures market either as existing positions held by traders, known as open interest.

The size and price of these orders may vary considerably, but the key element to consider is that the more opinions that are expressed in the market, the more liquid the market is.

Liquidity is such an important element of market opportunity because the more participants there are, the more expressions of opinion on the market, the greater the likelihood that a single trader will encounter another with an opposing viewpoint that results in you both agreeing on a quantity and price to trade. 

Compare the Natural Gas (NG) futures market to the U.S. natural gas (UNG) ETF market. One NG contract is equivalent to 10,000 mmbtu of natural gas exposure. At a price of $2.722 per mmbtu. The notional value of a contract is then:

Notional Value = 2.722 USD/mmtbu X 10,000 mmtbu = 27,200 USD

At an average daily volume of 322,441 contracts as of fourth quarter 2014, the dollar value total of natural gas futures traded between participants on an average day is just shy of $8.8 billion.

The UNG ETF contract, which tracks the price of natural gas, trades at $13.94 per share. UNG reports an average daily volume of 12,582,300 shares, making the average notional value traded within the market of only about $175 million per day.

## Managing Contract Expiration

Most traders are in the futures markets to profit from variations in price movement, they do not want a cash settlement or a physical delivery when their contracts expire. So only a small percentage of trades actually go through delivery.

### Liquidating
To avoid delivery, traders offset their position prior to expiration. One way to do this is by liquidating. A trader liquidates when they wish to exit an established position. 

### Rolling Contracts Forward
Rolling the contract forward means to offset your current position and establish a new position in a forward month. Traders do this when they do not want to give up their market exposure when the contract expires.

A trader with exposure in a March contract has to get out of the March position and move their interest into June.

There are two ways they can do this:

1. The first way is to leg in or initiate a spread. To leg in means selling the March contract, then buying a June contract in two separate transactions.
2. The second way is to initiate a spread, or position roll. With this option the closing order of the March contract and the opening order of the new June contract are executed simultaneously. Unlike legging in, there is no time gap between the two orders. That is important because a time gap can result in slippage, the potential loss from market moves between the closing and opening orders. 

## Benefit of Open Markets

If you are only an equity trader, when a market is closed and an opportunity arises, you cannot take advantage of it. And worse, if you need to exit a position, you have to wait until the market opens. Political events and natural disasters do not wait for the market to open and in a true global economy, many markets that affect the U.S. market trade outside U.S. market hours.

In the world of futures, you can make a move nearly 24 hours a day, 6 days a week. That means a futures trader can react as the event unfolds. Twenty four-hour access does not mean you have to stay glued to your trading screen. Say you are long in E-mini S&P position and you are concerned that China's manufacturing PMI report may be negative and drive the market lower. Instead of waiting for the report, you can place a stop order several hours before the report is released. It will be working while you are enjoying your evening.

## The Power of Leverage

Leverage is the ability to control a large contract value with a relatively small amount of capital. In the futures market, that capital is called performance bond, or initial margin, and is typically 3-12% of a contract's notional or cash value.

Assume that one E-mini S&P 500 future has a value of $103,800. You initiate a position by posting an initial margin of at least $5,060. In other words, you will have exposure to $103,800, but you have only put down a small percentage of the value. This is called greater capital efficiency.

### Exposure
Another benefit of leverage is gaining increased exposure. For example, if you have $10,000 with which you would like to express your opinion in the gold market. How can you maximize your $10,000? 

1. Buy physical gold at $1,250 per ounce. This would afford you 8 oz. of gold.

2. Purchase shares of a GLD ETF. If the current price is $125 on GLD, you would be able to purchase 160 shares. That would afford you $20,000 in market exposure and you control the equivalent of 16 oz. of gold. ETFs are subject to the Federal Regulation T requirement for 50% margin of purchase price, which means you can control $20,000 of exposure with $10,000 in capital.

3. Buy a Gold futures contract, which represents 100 oz. If initial margins are $4,400 you can buy two Gold futures contracts. You will have exposure to the equivalent of 200 oz. of gold.

## Benefits of Bid-Offer Spread

A Crude Oil futures contract is currently priced at 100 USD/barrel and one futures contract is comprised of 1,000 barrels. This give a notional value of $100,000. Since the minimum price fluctuation, or tick, for this contract is 0.01 USD/ barrel, then a one-tick change would be worth 10 USD.

If the current price of a crude oil ETF share is 38 USD, in order for an investor to manage the same notional value of one futures contract, the investor would need to purchase the equivalent of 2,632 ETF shares.

Assume the ETF also trades in 0.01 USD increments. A one-tick price movement in the ETF position would equate to a change of 26.32 USD while a one-tick move in the futures contract is only 10 USD. 

Tight bid offer spreads may lower one of the costs associated with getting into and out of a position.

## Request for Quotes (RFQ)

A Globex Request for Quote (RFQ) is an electronic notification sent to all Globex participants to solicit quotes in the central limit order book (CLOB) for a specific strategy or instrument. The sender isn't obligated to show directionality as a buyer or seller, and is not obligated to trade, as the RFQ is simply an indication of interest. In futures markets, RFQs can be used to request liquidity in an instrument where there are no active prices in the Globex order books or where improved liquidity is desired.

RFQs offer several advantages in futures markets:

Allows participants to solicit competitive quotes, even during times of low market activity. Speed, transparency and easy access of electronically traded markets, with the flexibility and efficient price discovery of a brokered market.
RFQs are particularly valuable in markets with a large variety of instruments and in nascent markets where liquidity is still developing.
