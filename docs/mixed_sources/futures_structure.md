# Futures Term Structures (Futures Curves)

## Introduction

Term structure refers to the relationship between future prices for different maturity dates. This reflects 
market expectations of future demand, supply and storage cost. By analizing this traders can understand poterntial returns,
risk and made informed decisions.

For example, if we want to hedge against rising prices (hedging as a consumer) we might buy long-term contracts when the market is in contango. In backwardation isnstead 
we might want to buy short-term contracts. Traders indeed can anticipate future structures by studying supply/demand mechanism.
If demand rises we expect growing prices, leading to a contango. The opposite occurs with increasing supply. 

## Term Structures Effect

Contango and backwardation arise as a result of inequality between the long and short positions of hedgers, which require the 
intervention of speculators to restore the equilibrium (Keynes 1930 and Cootner 1960). Shwayder and James in *Returns to the Commodity Carry Trade*
show a strategy where investors long backwardated contracts and short contangoes [to read!].
The idea is simple, if the supply by short hedgers exceeds the demand by long hedgers (hedgers are net short), then the future price will be 
downward biased.

Term-structure strategies have interesting properties such as: (1) low max drawdowns; (2) high max run-ups and (3) both lower minimum and 
higher maximum 12-months rolling return than the benchmark; (4) higher sortino ratio than the benchmark (passive); (5) ups and downs of the strategy and of the benchmark (
S&P GSCI) are non correlated to the S&P500.

Erb and Harvey in *The Tactical and Strategic Value of Commodity Futures* state that: (1) the average annualized excess return of commodity futures is around 0; (2)
commodity futures returns are uncorrelated with one another. Similar properties are highlighted by Durr and Voegeli in *Structural Properties of Commodity Futures Term Structures and Their Implications for Basic Trading Strategies*.

## Roll Yield

The roll yield is the *return generated by rolling a short-term contract into a longer-term one* nad profits from the convergence 
of the futures toward a higher spot/cash price. The roll yield, hence is positive in backwardation (with inverted curve -it can rarely happen backwardation and normal curve)

| Case # | Market Type           | Curve Shape     | Example Price Path                 | Roll Yield (long futures)                                                                |
| ------ | --------------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1      | Backwardation (F < S) | Inverted (down) | Spot = 100, 1M F = 95, 2M F = 90   | **Positive**: futures rise toward spot as they mature                                    |
| 2      | Backwardation (F < S) | Normal (up)     | Spot = 100, 1M F = 95, 2M F = 97   | **Positive (but smaller)**: near future still under spot, so still gains as it converges |
| 3      | Contango (F > S)      | Normal (up)     | Spot = 100, 1M F = 105, 2M F = 110 | **Negative**: futures fall toward spot as they mature                                    |
| 4      | Contango (F > S)      | Inverted (down) | Spot = 100, 1M F = 105, 2M F = 103 | **Negative (but smaller)**: still paying to roll up front                                |

What I mean here is that the normality of the curve is also importnat and backwardation is not sufficient as a single condition! Suppose we buy a contract with 3 months maturity at 95 USD and spot price 100 USD.
Now as we get closer to expiration the contract will reach the spot price. Say we sell at 99 USD and get another contract witht longer maturity (relative to the one we got at the beginning - which is about to expire)
again at 95 USD. The roll yield is 4 USD.

$$
\text{Roll Yield} = \Delta F - \Delta S = (F_{t+1} - F_t) - (S_{t+1} - S_t)
$$

## Inverted Markets

The most common reason of an inverted market are short-term disruption of supply. For crude oil, for example, OPEC policies restricting exports or, generally speaking,
whichever events reduces the supply (e.g. Russia-Ukraine conflict). For agricultural commodities, indeed, examples might be weather issues.

Normal curves are due to the cost of carry (storage, interest and insurance). They also include the opportunity cost as having money tied up in the commodity. A market is said to be in full carry when 
the future price is exacly equal to the cost of carry plus the spot price.

Let's have an example. Since 2020 some futures have been consistently inverted. Have a look at the BRENT between 2023 and 2024.
